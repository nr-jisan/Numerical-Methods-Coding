# üßÆ Numerical Methods in C

Welcome to my **Numerical Methods** repository! This collection of C programs provides efficient implementations of several classical numerical methods used to solve mathematical problems involving equations, interpolation, differentiation, and integration.

These methods are essential for anyone studying numerical analysis or working with computational mathematics. Each method is written in **pure C** for maximum control and efficiency.

## üìå Method Descriptions

### 1. Bisection Method
A simple, robust root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects the subinterval in which a root lies.

### 2. False Position Method
A variation of the bisection method that uses the secant line to approximate the root more effectively than simple bisection.

### 3. Newton-Raphson Method
An iterative technique that uses the function value and its derivative to find roots of equations more efficiently.

### 4. Lagrange Interpolation
An interpolation technique for constructing a polynomial that passes through a set of data points, useful for estimating intermediate values.

### 5. Trapezoidal Rule
Approximates the area under a curve by dividing the region into trapezoids and summing their areas. A simple and effective method for numerical integration.

### 6. Simpson's 1/3 Rule
A more accurate integration method that approximates the integrand with quadratic polynomials.

### 7. Simpson's 3/8 Rule
An extension of Simpson's 1/3 rule, using cubic polynomials for even higher precision in integration.

### 8. Euler's Method
A simple and intuitive approach to solving ordinary differential equations by using step-by-step approximations.

### 9. Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method
A widely used and highly accurate method for solving ordinary differential equations, providing a much higher level of precision compared to Euler‚Äôs method.
